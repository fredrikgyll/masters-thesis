In regards to the two initial research questions posed is this thesis and based upon the results of the experiments presented in Chapter~\ref{cha:results}, the following is given as the main conclusions.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item For the task of differentiating pollen grains, reducing the size of the network negatively affects performance. The uniformity of the objects in the dataset does however allow for a reduction in the number of detections made by the model without any apparent performance effects.
    \item Excluding multifocal data from training causes a fixation on sharp features, inhibiting the model to localize pollen grains, only slightly outside the focal range of the training data.
    \item Excluding multifocal data creates a more precise model with lower recall than a model trained on multifocal data.
\end{enumerate}
