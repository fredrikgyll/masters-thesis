\chapter*{Preface}

%{\it\color{red}The preface includes the facts --- What type of project, where it is conducted, who supervised, and any acknowledgments you wish to give.}

This master's thesis is written for the Department of Computer and Information Science at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology.
This project is a continuation of an unpublished specialization project thesis of the same name conducted in the Fall of 2020, which functioned as the literature review for this thesis. That project produced draft versions of Chapters~\ref{cha:Introduction},~\ref{cha:background}, and~\ref{cha:related}.

I want to thank my supervisor Professor Keith Downing for his invaluable guidance and insightful feedback. I also want to thank Trond Einar Brobakk and The Norwegian Asthma and Allergy Association for their help and expertise with the data collection.

Lastly, I would like to thank the Open Source Software community, without which this project could not exist.
