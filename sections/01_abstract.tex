\chapter*{Abstract}
This thesis explores how a CNN based object detection model may be used to localize and classify pollen grains using microscopic imaging data.
Pollen counting is a central method in many diverse fields, e.g.\ criminology, archaeology, and geology.
This is a laborious and very time-consuming task which currently requires expert knowledge.
An automated system would drastically increase the rate of data collection. 
At the time of writing, no system has been developed which uses images from a standard bright field microscope.
This thesis analyses the existing literature with the intention of developing a system which can both locate and classify pollen grains.
Multiple areas in need of further research with regards to both the model complexity required to solve the problem, and how to best to deal with multifocal data are found.
