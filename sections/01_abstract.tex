\chapter*{Abstract}
This thesis explores how a CNN based object detection model may be used to localize and classify pollen grains using microscopic imaging data.
Pollen counting is a central method in many diverse fields, e.g.,\ criminology, archaeology, and geology.
This is a laborious and very time-consuming task that currently requires expert knowledge.
From the literature, open questions remain with regards to the complexity needed to solve this problem versus more common object detection tasks.
The effects of sharpness within training examples are also unclear.
Experiments using a Single Shot Multibox Detection model reveal that the problem is solvable with a fully convolutional model.
The regular shape of pollen grains allows for certain simplifications to the model, but the similarities across classes cause a loss in accuracy in smaller model configurations.
Excluding un-sharp data from the model's training data causes the model to fixate on sharpness, reducing the model's ability to identify grains that appear less sharp.
Training with un-sharp examples seems to allow for a more robust generalization over the features encoded in multifocal data.
